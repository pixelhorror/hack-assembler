# Hack Assembler for NAND2Tetris

This is a quick and dirty implementation of the Hack Assembler detailed in the [course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course). It assumes proper syntax and it'll probably break if you don't follow.

# Details

Build using ES6 and nothing else.

# Usage

Clone and run using your favorite web server (i.e `python3 -m http.server`). Then select the file you want to compile and hit "Assemble", after that you can copy or download the generated Hack Machine code.
